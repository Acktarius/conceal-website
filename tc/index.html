				Conceal is an open source community project, which means that there is no company behind it. This project is supported by the community, meaning there is no stable, full-time team and no physical headquarters from which the projects runs its operations. The advantage here is that anyone can propose changes or improvements to the blockchain, and, if the suggestion is voted by a majority of people, the changes are then implemented. This project is intended to be a community project not a commercial product and relies on volunteers availibility.

			<p class="mb-5">
				Conceal.CLI, Conceal.Desktop, Conceal.Cloud and Conceal.Mobile are an open-source, client-side, free wallets which allow you to send and receive CCX instantly on the blockchain. You are in control of your funds & your keys. When you generate a new wallet, login, send, receive or deposit $CCX everything happens locally. Your seed is never transmitted, received or stored. That's why its imperative to write, print or save your seed somewhere safe. The backup of keys is your responsibility. If you lose your seed, your account can not be recovered. The Conceal Team doesn't take any responsibility for lost funds due to nonexistent/missing/lost private keys.

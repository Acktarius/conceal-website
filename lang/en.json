  "about_title": "What's Conceal?",

  "about_02": "Conceal.Network enables untraceable and anonymous messaging, and a secure way to transfer funds.

Hackers cannot trace money or messages when the messages are sent across public networks.",
  "about_03": "Conceal Cryptocurrency (₡CCX) is based on the Cryptonote protocol and runs on a secure peer-to-peer network technology to operate with no central authority. You control the private keys to your funds.",
  "about_04": "Conceal is accessible by anyone in the world regardless of their geographic location or status. Our blockchain is resistant to any kind of analysis. All your CCX transactions and messages are anonymous.",
  "about_05": "Conceal avoids many concerns, e.g. technological, environment impact, reputational and security, of Bitcoin, and provides a glimpse of the future.",
